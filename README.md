# PAMM
add on for miro for patent attorney mindmap - adds a link to a  note card for each text item

based on looking glass example of miro


at stage 1, simply sidebar copy
at stage 2 - create card and somehow link to item metadata and activate it using lookingglass - need to decide if card will be visible or not. can eb created at sidebar if not exist
at stage 3 - maybe show data in a modal, rather than side bar
at stage 4 - consider allowing to enter the data using same modal
at stage 5 - see if we can add a context menu item for all of this instead of command button
