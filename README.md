add on for miro for patent attorney mindmap - adds a link to a  note card for each text item

based on looking glass example of miro


at stage 1, simply sidebar copy

at stage 2 - create card and somehow link to item metadata and activate it using lookingglass - need to decide if card will be visible or not. can eb created at sidebar if not exist

at stage 3 - maybe show data in a modal, rather than side bar

at stage 4 - consider allowing to enter the data using same modal

at stage 5 - see if we can add a context menu item for all of this instead of command button. easy to add context, but what about in edit mode?

prefered ui: user edits an object, adds $detail, when he selecst a new item (selection changes?) computer builds a new card and puts info in it. upon further click on item, card contents appear (editable) in a modal window. q: can we add a button to edit mode or only to display mode? alternative: simply expand the object. name of card can be details_{textnodeid}

next level down: user clicks on object, fills in sidebar, which creates a card if needed. next click shows information in modal
next level down, all in side bar - enetringa nd display later
