# PAMM
add on for miro for patent attorney mindmap - adds a link to a  note card for each text item

based on looking glass example of miro


at stage 1, simply sidebar copy

at stage 2 - create card and somehow link to item metadata and activate it using lookingglass - need to decide if card will be visible or not. can eb created at sidebar if not exist

at stage 3 - maybe show data in a modal, rather than side bar

at stage 4 - consider allowing to enter the data using same modal

at stage 5 - see if we can add a context menu item for all of this instead of command button. easy to add context, but what about in edit mode?
